# BCC Study Group
This is for the Boston Code and Coffee Study group.  The motivation for developing this study group is 2 fold.  Firstly, to develop a forum we a group of people can work on learning and teaching a topic together as this falls inbetween making a full blown presentation after learning a topic and an ad hoc sharing what one person.  Secondly, to work on learning more theorectical topics as it tends to be ignored by many people who are largely self taught.  Ultimately, it is to teach each other the theory behind the tools we use each day.

I haven't found the best forum for asking/answering question and posting presentations at the meetups.  I am just not sure if the discord server or github works better for the type of interaction works best, though until I can get discord setup, we can use this repository and this repository can be moved to someplace more appropriate in the future.

Questions can be asked and answered in the issues and we can work on editing the answers to be more complete over time.

# Current study topic:

We are currently working through the online software foundations books found here:

[https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu)

In order to be consistent, download the current copy of the books, this way they will not change as we work through them.  Keep in mind that they may refer to coq, and that coq has been rebranded as rocq.  

I have set up a separate repository for rocq's configuration in a dockerfile, and some suggestions as to how to setup VS code to work with rocq's docker image.  Although I am currently using this with VS Code, I am not opposed to setting up emacs to run in the docker image which can also be used with rocq.  My repository for this is located here:
